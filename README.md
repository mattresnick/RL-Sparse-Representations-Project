# RL-Sparse-Representations-Project

Descriptions and instructions for running much of the code can be found in Sparse Representation Models. PrioritizedReplayBuffer 
contains all code relevant to the PER implementation, and Backup is just old code that I didn't want to get rid of, just in case 
we ended up needing something.
